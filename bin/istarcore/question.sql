The butterfly that flapped its wings was the much-reiterated statement in a much publicized report that hardly a fourth of graduating engineers, and an even smaller percentage of other graduates, was of employable quality for IT ¿ BPO jobs. This triggered a cyclone when similar views were echoed by other sectors which led to widespread debate. Increased industry ¿ academia interaction, &quot;finishing schools&quot;, and other efforts were initiated as immediate measures to bridge skill deficits. These however did not work as some felt that these are but band-aid solutions; instead, radical systemic reform is necessary.Yet, there will be serious challenges to overdue reforms in the education system. In India as in many countries-education is treated as a holy cow; sadly the administrative system that oversees it has also been deceived. Today unfortunately there is no protest against selling drinking water or paying to be cured of illness, or for having to buy food when one is poor and starving; nor is there an outcry that in all these cases there are commercial companies operating on a profit-making basis. Why then is there an instinctively adverse reaction to the formal entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; institutes n the realm of education ? Is potable water health or food less basic a need less important a right than higher education? While there are strong arguments for free or subsidized higher education, we are not writing on a blank page. Some individuals and businessmen had entered this sector long back and found devious ways of making money, though the law stipulates that educational institutes must be &#39;not-for profit&#39; trusts or societies. Yet, there is opposition to the entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; corporates, which would be more transparent and accountable. As a result, desperately needed investment in promoting the wider reach of quality education has been stagnated at a time when financial figures indicate that the allocation of funds for the purpose is but a fourth of the need. Well-run corporate organizations, within an appropriate regulatory framework, would be far better than the so-called trusts which-barring some noteworthy exceptions, are a blot on education. However, it is not necessarily a question of choosing one over the other; different organizational forms can coexist, as they do in the health sector. A regulatory framework which creates competition in tandem with a rating system would automatically ensure the quality and relevance of education. As in sectors like Telecom, and packaged goods, organizations will quickly expand into the hinterland to tap the large unmet demand Easy Loan/scholarship arrangements would ensure affordability and access. The only real structural reform in higher education was the creation of the institutes for technology and management. They were also given autonomy and freedom beyond that of the universities. However in the last few years, determined efforts have been underway to curb their autonomy. These institutes however, need freedom to decide on recruitment salaries and admissions so as to compete globally. However, such institutes will be few. Therefore, we need a regulatory framework that will enable and encourage States and the Centre, genuine philanthropists and also corporate to set up quality educational institutions. The regulatory system needs only to ensure transparency, accountability, competition and widely-available independent assessments or ratings. It is time for radical thinking, bold experimentation and new structures; it is time for the government to bite the bullet.

Read the passage carefully and select the best answers from among the given choices for each question. The questions are to be answered on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage. The painter is now free to paint anything he chooses. There are scarcely any forbidden subjects, and today everybody is prepared to admit that a painting of some fruit can be as important as a painting of a hero dying. The impressionists did as much as anybody to win this previously unheard of freedom for the artist. Yet, by the next generation, painters began to abandon the subject altogether, and began to paint abstract pictures. Today the majority of pictures painted are abstract. Is there a connection between these two developments? Has art gone abstract because the artist is embarrassed by this freedom? Is it that, because he is free to paint any anything, he doesn&#39;t know what to paint? Apologists for abstract art often talk of it as the art of maximum freedom. But could this be the freedom of the desert island? It would take too long to answer these questions properly. I believe there is a connection. Many things have encouraged the development of abstract art. Among them has been the artists¿ wish to avoid the difficulties of finding subjects when all subjects are equally possible. I raise the matter now because I want to draw attention to the fact that the painter¿s choice of a subject is a far more complicated question that it would at first seem. A subject starts with the painter deciding he would like to paint such-and-such because for some reason or other he finds it meaningful. A subject begins when the artist selects something for special mention. (When makes it special or meaningful may seem to the artist to be purely visual¿its colors or its form). When the subject has been selected, the function of the painting itself is to communicate and justify the significance of that selection. It is often said today that subject matter is unimportant. But this is only a reaction against the excessively literary and moralistic interpretation of subject matter in the nineteenth century. In truth the subject is literally the beginning and end of a painting. The painting begins with a selection (I will paint this and not everything else in the world); it is finished when that selection is justified (now you can see all that I saw and felt in this and how it is more than merely itself). Thus, for a painting to succeed it is essential that the painter and his public agree about what is significant. The subject may have a personal meaning for the painter or individual spectator; but there must also be the possibility of their agreement on its general meaning. It is at this point that the culture of the society and period in question precedes the artist and his art. Renaissance art would have meant nothing to the Aztecs¿and vice versa. If, to some extent, a few intellectuals can appreciate them both today it is because their culture is an historical one: its inspiration is history and therefore it can include within itself, in principle if not in every particular, all known developments to date. When a culture is secure and certain of its values, it presents its artists with subjects. The general agreement about what is significant is so well established that the significance of a particular subject accrues and becomes traditional. That is true, for instance, of reeds and water in China, of the nude body in Renaissance, of the animal in Africa. Furthermore, in such cultures the artist is unlikely to be a free agent: he will be employed for the sake of particular subjects, and the problem, as we have just described it, will not occur to him. When a culture is in a state of disintegration or transition, the freedom of the artist increases¿but the question of subject matter becomes problematic for him: he, himself, has to choose for society. This was at the basis of all the increasing crises in European art during the nineteenth century. It is too often forgotten how many of the art scandals of that time were provoked by the choice of subject (Gericault, Courbet, Daumier, Degas, Lautrec, Van Gogh, etc.). By the end of the nineteenth century there were, roughly speaking, two ways in which the painter could meet this challenge of deciding what to paint and so choosing for society. Either he identified himself with the people and so allowed their lives to dictate his subjects to him; or he had to find his subjects within himself as painter. By people I mean everybody except the bourgeoisie. Many painters did of course work for the bourgeoisie according to their copy-book of approved subjects, but all of them, filling the Salon and the Royal Academy year after year, are now forgotten, buried under the hypocrisy of those they served so sincerely.

The butterfly that flapped its wings was the much-reiterated statement in a much publicized report that hardly a fourth of graduating engineers, and an even smaller percentage of other graduates, was of employable quality for IT ? BPO jobs. This triggered a cyclone when similar views were echoed by other sectors which led to widespread debate. Increased industry ? academia interaction, "finishing schools", and other efforts were initiated as immediate measures to bridge skill deficits. These however did not work as some felt that these are but band-aid solutions; instead, radical systemic reform is necessary.Yet, there will be serious challenges to overdue reforms in the education system. In India as in many countries-education is treated as a holy cow; sadly the administrative system that oversees it has also been deceived. Today unfortunately there is no protest against selling drinking water or paying to be cured of illness, or for having to buy food when one is poor and starving; nor is there an outcry that in all these cases there are commercial companies operating on a profit-making basis. Why then is there an instinctively adverse reaction to the formal entry of ''for-profit'' institutes n the realm of education ? Is potable water health or food less basic a need less important a right than higher education? While there are strong arguments for free or subsidized higher education, we are not writing on a blank page. Some individuals and businessmen had entered this sector long back and found devious ways of making money, though the law stipulates that educational institutes must be ''not-for profit'' trusts or societies. Yet, there is opposition to the entry of ''for-profit'' corporates, which would be more transparent and accountable. As a result, desperately needed investment in promoting the wider reach of quality education has been stagnated at a time when financial figures indicate that the allocation of funds for the purpose is but a fourth of the need. Well-run corporate organizations, within an appropriate regulatory framework, would be far better than the so-called trusts which-barring some noteworthy exceptions, are a blot on education. However, it is not necessarily a question of choosing one over the other; different organizational forms can coexist, as they do in the health sector. A regulatory framework which creates competition in tandem with a rating system would automatically ensure the quality and relevance of education. As in sectors like Telecom, and packaged goods, organizations will quickly expand into the hinterland to tap the large unmet demand Easy Loan/scholarship arrangements would ensure affordability and access. The only real structural reform in higher education was the creation of the institutes for technology and management. They were also given autonomy and freedom beyond that of the universities. However in the last few years, determined efforts have been underway to curb their autonomy. These institutes however, need freedom to decide on recruitment salaries and admissions so as to compete globally. However, such institutes will be few. Therefore, we need a regulatory framework that will enable and encourage States and the Centre, genuine philanthropists and also corporate to set up quality educational institutions. The regulatory system needs only to ensure transparency, accountability, competition and widely-available independent assessments or ratings. It is time for radical thinking, bold experimentation and new structures; it is time for the government to bite the bullet.

The butterfly that flapped its wings was the much-reiterated statement in a much publicized report that hardly a fourth of graduating engineers, and an even smaller percentage of other graduates, was of employable quality for IT ¿ BPO jobs. This triggered a cyclone when similar views were echoed by other sectors which led to widespread debate. Increased industry ¿ academia interaction, &quot;finishing schools&quot;, and other efforts were initiated as immediate measures to bridge skill deficits. These however did not work as some felt that these are but band-aid solutions; instead, radical systemic reform is necessary.Yet, there will be serious challenges to overdue reforms in the education system. In India as in many countries-education is treated as a holy cow; sadly the administrative system that oversees it has also been deceived. Today unfortunately there is no protest against selling drinking water or paying to be cured of illness, or for having to buy food when one is poor and starving; nor is there an outcry that in all these cases there are commercial companies operating on a profit-making basis. Why then is there an instinctively adverse reaction to the formal entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; institutes n the realm of education ? Is potable water health or food less basic a need less important a right than higher education? While there are strong arguments for free or subsidized higher education, we are not writing on a blank page. Some individuals and businessmen had entered this sector long back and found devious ways of making money, though the law stipulates that educational institutes must be &#39;not-for profit&#39; trusts or societies. Yet, there is opposition to the entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; corporates, which would be more transparent and accountable. As a result, desperately needed investment in promoting the wider reach of quality education has been stagnated at a time when financial figures indicate that the allocation of funds for the purpose is but a fourth of the need. Well-run corporate organizations, within an appropriate regulatory framework, would be far better than the so-called trusts which-barring some noteworthy exceptions, are a blot on education. However, it is not necessarily a question of choosing one over the other; different organizational forms can coexist, as they do in the health sector. A regulatory framework which creates competition in tandem with a rating system would automatically ensure the quality and relevance of education. As in sectors like Telecom, and packaged goods, organizations will quickly expand into the hinterland to tap the large unmet demand Easy Loan/scholarship arrangements would ensure affordability and access. The only real structural reform in higher education was the creation of the institutes for technology and management. They were also given autonomy and freedom beyond that of the universities. However in the last few years, determined efforts have been underway to curb their autonomy. These institutes however, need freedom to decide on recruitment salaries and admissions so as to compete globally. However, such institutes will be few. Therefore, we need a regulatory framework that will enable and encourage States and the Centre, genuine philanthropists and also corporate to set up quality educational institutions. The regulatory system needs only to ensure transparency, accountability, competition and widely-available independent assessments or ratings. It is time for radical thinking, bold experimentation and new structures; it is time for the government to bite the bullet.

The butterfly that flapped its wings was the much-reiterated statement in a much publicized report that hardly a fourth of graduating engineers, and an even smaller percentage of other graduates, was of employable quality for IT ¿ BPO jobs. This triggered a cyclone when similar views were echoed by other sectors which led to widespread debate. Increased industry ¿ academia interaction, &quot;finishing schools&quot;, and other efforts were initiated as immediate measures to bridge skill deficits. These however did not work as some felt that these are but band-aid solutions; instead, radical systemic reform is necessary.Yet, there will be serious challenges to overdue reforms in the education system. In India as in many countries-education is treated as a holy cow; sadly the administrative system that oversees it has also been deceived. Today unfortunately there is no protest against selling drinking water or paying to be cured of illness, or for having to buy food when one is poor and starving; nor is there an outcry that in all these cases there are commercial companies operating on a profit-making basis. Why then is there an instinctively adverse reaction to the formal entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; institutes n the realm of education ? Is potable water health or food less basic a need less important a right than higher education? While there are strong arguments for free or subsidized higher education, we are not writing on a blank page. Some individuals and businessmen had entered this sector long back and found devious ways of making money, though the law stipulates that educational institutes must be &#39;not-for profit&#39; trusts or societies. Yet, there is opposition to the entry of &#39;for-profit&#39; corporates, which would be more transparent and accountable. As a result, desperately needed investment in promoting the wider reach of quality education has been stagnated at a time when financial figures indicate that the allocation of funds for the purpose is but a fourth of the need. Well-run corporate organizations, within an appropriate regulatory framework, would be far better than the so-called trusts which-barring some noteworthy exceptions, are a blot on education. However, it is not necessarily a question of choosing one over the other; different organizational forms can coexist, as they do in the health sector. A regulatory framework which creates competition in tandem with a rating system would automatically ensure the quality and relevance of education. As in sectors like Telecom, and packaged goods, organizations will quickly expand into the hinterland to tap the large unmet demand Easy Loan/scholarship arrangements would ensure affordability and access. The only real structural reform in higher education was the creation of the institutes for technology and management. They were also given autonomy and freedom beyond that of the universities. However in the last few years, determined efforts have been underway to curb their autonomy. These institutes however, need freedom to decide on recruitment salaries and admissions so as to compete globally. However, such institutes will be few. Therefore, we need a regulatory framework that will enable and encourage States and the Centre, genuine philanthropists and also corporate to set up quality educational institutions. The regulatory system needs only to ensure transparency, accountability, competition and widely-available independent assessments or ratings. It is time for radical thinking, bold experimentation and new structures; it is time for the government to bite the bullet.According to the author, what ¿triggered a cyclone¿ which saw similar views on the state of education being echoed across other sectors as well?

Nitroglycerin has long been famous forts relief of angina pectoris attacks but ruled out for heart attacks on the theory that it harmfully lowers blood pressure and increases heart rate. A heart attack, unlike an angina attack, always involves some localized, fairly rapid heart muscle death, or myocardial infarction. This acute emergency happens when the arteriosclerotic occlusive process in one of the coronary arterial branches culminates so suddenly and completely that the local myocardium¿the muscle area that was fed by the occluded coronary¿ stops contracting and dies over a period of hours, to be replaced over a period of weeks by a scar, or ¿healed infarct.¿In 1974, in experiments with dogs, it was discovered that administration of nitroglycerin during the acute stage of myocardial infarction consistently reduced the extent of myocardial injury, provided that the dogs¿ heart rate and blood pressure were maintained in the normal range. Soon after, scientists made preliminary confirmation of the clinical applicability of nitroglycerin in acute heart attack in human patients. Five of twelve human subjects developed some degree of congestive heart failure. Curiously, the nitroglycerin alone was enough to reduce the magnitude of injury in these five patients, but the other seven patients, whose heart attacks were not complicated by any congestive heart failure, were not consistently helped by the nitroglycerin until another drug, phenylephrine, was added to abolish the nitroglycerin induced drop in blood pressure. One explanation for this is that the reflex responses in heart rate, mediated through the autonomic nervous system, are so blunted in congestive heart failure that a fall in blood pressure prompts less of the cardiac acceleration which otherwise worsens the damage of acute myocardial infarction. It appears that the size of the infarct that would otherwise result from a coronary occlusion might be greatly reduced, and vitally needed heart muscle thus saved, by the actions of certain drugs and other measures taken during the acute phase of the heart attack. This is because the size of the myocardial infarct is not really determined at the moment of the coronary occlusion as previously thought. The fate of the stricken myocardial segment remains largely undetermined, hanging on the balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand which can be favorably influenced for many hours after the coronary occlusion. So it is possible to reduce the myocardial ischemic injury during acute human heart attacks by means of nitro-glycerin, either alone or in combination with phenylephrine. Other drugs are also being tested to reduce myocardial infarct size, particularly drugs presumed to affect molar dial oxygen supply and demand, including not only vessel dilators such as nitro-glycerin but also anti-hypertensive¿s , which block the sympathetic nerve re-flexes that increase heart rate and work in response to exertion and stress. Such measures are still experimental, and there is no proof of benefit with regard tithe great complications of heart attack such as carcinogenic shock, angina, or mortality. But the drugs for reducing infarct size now hold center stage in experimental frameworks.

The butterfly that flapped its wings was the much-reiterated statement in a much publicized report that hardly a fourth of graduating engineers, and an even smaller percentage of other graduates, was of employable quality for IT ? BPO jobs. This triggered a cyclone when similar views were echoed by other sectors which led to widespread debate. Increased industry ? academia interaction, "finishing schools", and other efforts were initiated as immediate measures to bridge skill deficits. These however did not work as some felt that these are but band-aid solutions; instead, radical systemic reform is necessary.Yet, there will be serious challenges to overdue reforms in the education system. In India as in many countries-education is treated as a holy cow; sadly the administrative system that oversees it has also been deceived. Today unfortunately there is no protest against selling drinking water or paying to be cured of illness, or for having to buy food when one is poor and starving; nor is there an outcry that in all these cases there are commercial companies operating on a profit-making basis. Why then is there an instinctively adverse reaction to the formal entry of ''for-profit'' institutes n the realm of education ? Is potable water health or food less basic a need less important a right than higher education? While there are strong arguments for free or subsidized higher education, we are not writing on a blank page. Some individuals and businessmen had entered this sector long back and found devious ways of making money, though the law stipulates that educational institutes must be ''not-for profit'' trusts or societies. Yet, there is opposition to the entry of ''for-profit'' corporates, which would be more transparent and accountable. As a result, desperately needed investment in promoting the wider reach of quality education has been stagnated at a time when financial figures indicate that the allocation of funds for the purpose is but a fourth of the need. Well-run corporate organizations, within an appropriate regulatory framework, would be far better than the so-called trusts which-barring some noteworthy exceptions, are a blot on education. However, it is not necessarily a question of choosing one over the other; different organizational forms can coexist, as they do in the health sector. A regulatory framework which creates competition in tandem with a rating system would automatically ensure the quality and relevance of education. As in sectors like Telecom, and packaged goods, organizations will quickly expand into the hinterland to tap the large unmet demand Easy Loan/scholarship arrangements would ensure affordability and access. The only real structural reform in higher education was the creation of the institutes for technology and management. They were also given autonomy and freedom beyond that of the universities. However in the last few years, determined efforts have been underway to curb their autonomy. These institutes however, need freedom to decide on recruitment salaries and admissions so as to compete globally. However, such institutes will be few. Therefore, we need a regulatory framework that will enable and encourage States and the Centre, genuine philanthropists and also corporate to set up quality educational institutions. The regulatory system needs only to ensure transparency, accountability, competition and widely-available independent assessments or ratings. It is time for radical thinking, bold experimentation and new structures; it is time for the government to bite the bullet.According to the author,which of the following was the only step taken in order to reform the higher education?', 1, now(),  1, 1, 60,'Creation of autonomous institutes for management and technology which were not under university control.', NULL, 1);
